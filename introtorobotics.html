  <h2>Day 1: Intro to Robotics</h2>
  <p>I used to think robots had to have some characteristics of or be associated with a living thing, but I don't think that's true in general. At least, not according to the class definition of robot.</p>
  <p>I'm most excited about artificial intelligence. Right now I'm interested in teaching robots to process and speak human language, and to a lesser extent, to move and emote like humans.</p>
  <p>I'm nervous about self-driving cars and developments like Toymail in that they might get hacked. I'm not really worried about self-driving cars crashing or breaking down, because eventually there must be trust in technology. When I board a plane, I'm trusting that the piloting systems won't break down horribly enough that the plane will crash or explode with a reasonable probability, because planes have been used for a while and we've worked out many of the bugs. Of course, I <em>could</em> die horribly, but the convenience outweighs the risk, so I choose to take the plane. I anticipate that the same will be true for self-driving cars, someday at least. Sure, the logic isn't exactly sound, but I worry too much in general, and I'm glad that there's at least one thing I'm not worried about.</p>
