  <h2 style="font-family:'Sacramento',cursive">Day 1: Intro to Robotics</h2>
  <p>I used to think robots had to have some characteristics of or be associated with a living thing, but I don't think that's true in general. At least, not according to the class definition of robot.</p>
  <p>I'm most excited about artificial intelligence. Right now I'm interested in teaching robots to process and speak human language, and to a lesser extent, to move and emote like humans.</p>
  <p>I'm nervous about self-driving cars and developments like Toymail in that they might get hacked. I'm not really worried about self-driving cars crashing or breaking down, because eventually there must be trust in technology. When I board a plane, I'm trusting that the piloting systems won't break down horribly enough that the plane will crash or explode with a reasonable probability, because planes have been used for a while and we've worked out many of the bugs. Of course, I <em>could</em> die horribly, but the convenience outweighs the risk, so I choose to take the plane. I anticipate that the same will be true for self-driving cars, someday at least. Sure, the logic isn't exactly sound, but I worry too much in general, and I'm glad that there's at least one thing I'm not worried about.</p>
  <p>The second is a difficult question to answer, given that it's three days after the fact. I think I'm still having the same problems, which are that I don't really listen to other people, so I need to tone my pride down a little.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Sacramento',cursive">Day 2: Blinking LEDs</h2>
  <p>My teamwork needs a lot of improvement, as I discovered today. For context, we made the lights blink in time to Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You". Each note in the key of the song had a corresponding LED of a different color, so for example C-sharp was red, D-sharp was orange, et cetera. I would read off the color of LED that needed to blink and the length of the note, and Annie would write the code. Of course I understood the code and I could've written it myself, but it was more efficient this way. The problems are evident: Annie had to do all the grunt work. I tried to suggest other arrangements or teach her how to read music so that she could interpret the sheet music herself, but we didn't do either. I still feel awful about it.</p>
  <p>I don't think anything was good about my teamwork. I tried to be accommodating to Annie's choices, including the hyper-precision necessary to line the LEDs up with the song. (We calculated delays sometimes down to hundredths or thousandths of a millisecond.)</p>
  <p>The basic parts of an Arduino sketch are the setup and the loop functions. In the setup you can initialize everything and write all the code that only needs to be executed once. In the loop function you can write everything that needs to be repeated forever, or at least until the program stops.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Sacramento',cursive">Day 3: Dance Party</h2>
  <p>I didn't know how servos worked before. I kind of assumed that they worked by you setting the rotation speed or something, but it turns out to be a lot more complicated, because you have to set the duration of each pulse sent to the servo.</p>
  <p>We tried to line up the robot's motions with the words of the song ("Shape of You"). My favorite part was when the robot moved back and forth as if being pushed and pulled by an invisible force. (Corresponding lyrics: "We push and pull like a magnet do.") I also liked that, again, we calculated the duration of each dance move very precisely so that the robot really seemed to dance to the music and so that it was coordinated with the light show.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Sacramento',cursive">Day 4: Escape Bot</h2>
  <p>This is our son Bobby dancing!</p>

  <p>My favorite part of this project was learning about how the whisker wire circuit worked. It was interesting because although I learned about circuits in physics last year, this was the first time I actually made a circuit.</p>
  <p>Maria and Kaylee worked fine with each other and with me. I should've participated more.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Sacramento',cursive">MVC Questions</h2>
  <p>An MVC paradigm is a pattern used to build applications. The M stands for model, the part that stores the data. The controller (C) handles user input, and the view (V) is the user interface -- what the user sees.</p>
  <p>Frameworks are a reusable design that handles common tasks so, for example, you don't have to suffer through the same procedures 6,000,000 other programmers before you did just to make a website, you can get straight to customizing.</p>
  <p>A library is a specific collection of files and code, while a framework is anything you use to make your project.</p>
  
  <h2 style="font-family:'Sacramento',cursive">Django Blog</h2>
  <p>What I was working on adding was a publish button on the New Post page. I find it very frustrating that to publish a post you have to first save it, then publish it from the Post Details button. Also on the same page, a Delete button. I mean, you can delete a draft by loading another page, but a Delete button would be more user friendly. Generally a lot more buttons, I'd say. Also, I'd do the Security homework from the extensions, because it seems to me that you can just edit a post by going to the editing URL.</p>
  <p>Does this mean "blog" instead of "portfolio page"? If so, you could modify it slightly to create a site for a webcomic. You could make the portfolio page with the blog design. You could do most anything, really.</p>
  <p>Until I started trying to add more buttons, I was just typing whatever was in the tutorial. I didn't really know what was going on. So I'd like more practice with everything. I wanted to continue debugging the buttons because that process taught me a lot about the structure of the program, more than the rest of the tutorial, I think.</p>
  <p>I don't understand the regular expressions they used in the URL page. They look like gibberish. I tried reading the URL page they linked to in the tutorial, but it didn't shed much light on the matter. Again, I also don't really understand the structure of the program.</p>
