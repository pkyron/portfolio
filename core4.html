          <th>Core4 Concept</th>

        <!-- Fill in the row for Variables -->
        <tr>
        <td><b>Variables</b></td>
          <td>A storage location containing some quantity of information, its value, that is liable to change</td>
          <td>Your age (in years) is a variable because you have a definite age at each moment and your age changes every year.</td>
          <td></td>
          <td><img src="variable example change ball velocity.PNG"/><br/>
          This is an example from my Paddleball game, increasing the variable controlling the velocity of the ball by 0.25 (making it faster).</td>
        </tr>

        <!-- Fill in the row for Loops -->
        <tr>
          <td><b>Loops</b></td>
          <td>A series of instructions that is continually repeated until some condition is reached.</td>
          <td>Breathing is like a looped action, because you're (almost) always breathing until you die.</td>
          <td>  </td>
          <td><img src="loop example draw cycloid.PNG"/><br/>
          This is an example use of a repeat until loop. It draws a cycloid using parametric equations with parameter t.
          The repeat until loop is used to draw the cycloid from t=0 to t=180.</td>
        </tr>

        <!-- Fill in the row for Conditionals -->
        <tr>
          <td><b>Conditionals</b></td>
          <td>A feature that performs different actions depending on a programmer-specified Boolean (true-false) value.</td>
          <td>In the United States, some laws apply differently to you depending on how old you are.
          For example, if you're under 21, you can't legally drink alcohol, meaning you may be punished if you do.
          If you're 21 or over, however, it's all good.</td>
          <td>  </td>
          <td><img src="conditional example if ball touches something.PNG"/><br/>
          I used this conditional in my Paddleball game to sense if the ball needed to bounce. It makes the ball bounce
          if the ball is touching the sides or the edge of the screen.</td>
        </tr>

        <!-- Fill in the row for Functions -->
        <tr>
          <td><b>Functions</b></td>
          <td>A series of code that performs an action.</td>
          <td>Chewing is a function. It performs a specified series of actions and can be repeated many times.</td>
          <td>  </td>
          <td><img src="function example change score.PNG"/><br/>
          I used this custom function to increase the player's score several times during Paddleball. Note the use of parameters.</td>
